# Having unique ids

Having a unique id on each row can be achieved with `createRow`, `duplicateRow`, and `isRowEmpty` props.

A user can only delete a row pressing the `Del` key if it is empty. By default a row is considered empty if all keys of
the object are falsy, and since the id is always present, rows can never be deleted simply by pressing `Del`.
This is why we override this behavior by specifying our own `isRowEmpty` function.

Try deleting rows using the `Del` key, creating new rows, or duplicating rows:

<UniqueIds />

```tsx
<DataSheetGrid
  createRow={() => ({ id: genId() })}
  duplicateRow={({ rowData }) => ({ ...rowData, id: genId() })}
  isRowEmpty={({ rowData }) => !rowData.firstName && !rowData.lastName}
/>
```
