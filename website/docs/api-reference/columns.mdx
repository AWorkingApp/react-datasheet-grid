# Columns

Columns are simple objects and can be declared as such:
```tsx
const columns = [
  { title: 'A', /*...*/ },
  { title: 'B', /*...*/ },
]
```

## title
> Type: `JSX.Element`<br />
> Default: `null`

Element to display in the header row.

## Sizing
### width
> Type: `string | number`<br />
> Default: `1`

Width of the column, supports the same values as the CSS [flex property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex).

#### Fixed sized columns
```tsx
const column = { width: '0 0 100px' }
```

`'0 0 <width>px'` for fixed width of `<width>` pixels. This syntaxe is the same than the shorthand property of flex and is equivalent to:

```css
flex-grow: 0;
flex-shrink: 0;
flex-basis: <width>px;
```

#### Relative sized columns
```tsx
const columns = [
  { width: 1 },
  { width: 1 },
  { width: 2 }, // ðŸ‘ˆ This column will grow and shrink like the others but will be twice as large
]
```

`<number>` for responsive columns. This is equivalent to:

```css
flex-grow: <number>;
flex-shrink: <number>;
flex-basis: 0;
```

### minWidth
> Type: `number`<br />
> Default: `100`

Minimum width of the column in pixels. Can be `0` for no minimum value.

### maxWidth
> Type: `number | null`<br />
> Default: `null`

Maximum width of the column in pixels. Can be `null` for no maximum value.

## Copy pasting
### copyValue
> Type: `({ rowData }) => number | string | null`

A function that returns the value of the copied cell. If the user copies multiple cells at once, this function
will be called multiple times.  It can return a string, a number, or null, but it will always be turned into a string
in the end.


### pasteValue
> Type: `({ rowData, value }) => any`

A function that takes in a row and the `value`  to be pasted, and should return the updated row. If the value should
be ignored, it should still return the unchanged row. The `value` is always a string and should therefore be casted
to whatever type is needed.

It is recommended to make sure that the `pasteValue` can handle all values returned from `copyValue` otherwise a
user might ba able to copy something but not paste it.

### deleteValue
> Type: `({ rowData }) => any`

A function that deletes the column value of a row. Used when the user cuts, clears a cell, or deletes a row.

## Rendering
### component
> Type: `Component`

A react component that renders a cell. [See props](cell-components)

### columnData
> Type: `any`

A value to pass to every cell component of the column through the `columnData` prop. Usually used to hold some kind
of options for the column.

For example, to implement a select column you would use `columnData` to pass the choices:
```tsx
const SelectComponent = ({ columnData: choices }) => {
  // Render cell using `choices`
}

const selectColumn = (choices) => ({
  columnData: choices,
  component: SelectComponent,
})

function App() {
  return <DataSheetGrid columns={[
    { ...selectColumn(['Light', 'Dark']), title: 'Theme' }
  ]} />
}
```

## Options
### disabled
> Type: `boolean | (({ rowData }) => boolean)`<br />
> Default: `false`

Disable the entire column by passing `true`, or disable it for specific rows by passing a function. Disabled cells
cannot be edited but their values can still be copied.

Try toggling the "active" column:

<DisableColumns />

```tsx
<DataSheetGrid
  columns={[
    { title: 'Active', /*...*/ },
    { title: 'First name', disabled: ({ rowData }) => !rowData.active, /*...*/ },
    { title: 'Last name', disabled: true, /*...*/ },
  ]}
/>
```

### renderWhenScrolling
> Type: `boolean`<br />
> Default: `true`

When set to `false`, the column waits for the scroll to stop to render new cells.
[More details](../performance/cell-components#slow-components-and-scrolling) about performance.

### disableKeys
> Type: `boolean`<br />
> Default: `false`

Usually when the user is editing a cell, pressing the up, down, or return key will exit editing mode.
Setting `disableKeys` to `true` will prevent this behavior. This is used when the widget needs to handle the up and
down keys itself (eg. to increase the value, or select a choice). Usually the widget also needs to handle the return
key by calling [stopEditing](cell-components#stopediting).

### keepFocus
> Type: `boolean`<br />
> Default: `false`

When you implement a widget using a portal (ie. a div that is not a direct children of the cell) you might
want the cell to keep focus when the user interacts with that element (even tho it is actually
outside of the grid itself). This means that you have to handle the click event and call [stopEditing](cell-components#stopediting)
yourself to release focus.
